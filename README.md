# Sample React App

This is an App to be run in the Zowe UI, which helps demonstrate how to build an App using React which can make use of the framework objects and features present in both React and ZLUX, the underlying technology of the Zowe UI.

You can compare and contrast this to two other sample Apps:
Angular: https://github.com/zowe/sample-angular-app
IFrame: https://github.com/zowe/sample-iframe-app

**Note: This App requires the [Sample Angular App](https://github.com/zowe/sample-angular-app) to be installed, because it imports the dataservice from the Angular App for example purposes. [Read more about import here](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/wiki/ZLUX-Dataservices)**

**To request features or report bugs, please use the issues page at the [zlux repo](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/issues) with the sample-app or app tags**
